                  <!-- Project Overview -->
                Bunu is a mobile app that connects skilled artisans in Nigeria with clients who are nearby. These artisans will provide services like plumbing, electrical engineering, auto mechanics, etc. The common artisans in Nigerian states are anticipated to be listed in this app's database.

                  <!-- Problem statement text -->
                  The challenge with existing artisan service apps is the lack of efficient user-artisan connections. Users struggle to discover skilled artisans nearby, leading to delayed service requests. Our goal is to create an artisan app that streamlines these connections, making it easier for users to find and hire local artisans promptly.
               </p> 
            
               <h2 class="project__title">Target Audience</h2>
               <p class="project__description">
                  <!-- Target audience text -->
                  The age group for both users and artisans can vary widely, but it's typically within the range of 18 to 65+ years. People of various ages may require artisan services, and artisans themselves can range from younger individuals to experienced professionals. I made it essential to ensure that the app's user interface and user experience cater to a broad age demographic by considering usability and accessibility for all potential users. <br> <br>
                  The target audience for your artisan mobile app would likely include:

                  We knew we needed blue in our primary palette. not just because we all liked blue. The colour helps in improving the flow of communication and we believe it is really important for us, as we are placing our self as the premier application for sourcing artisans.
                  <br>
                  The next step was to find out the best and unique blue. It should represent our brand, Bunu. It should also be different from Facebook, Twitter and any other app colours.
